## OLS-Regression-Analysis: Client project
Ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis carried out in this project. The selected dependent variables are some public health indicators. 
We tried to find the independent variables which are responsible for this health hazard. Multicollinearity, Heteroscadasticiy and normality assupmtion checked after model fitting.
We had similar analysis done in Stata as well. After model fitted in R we compared the results between two software outputs. 


## Dependent variables:
1. Anaxity
2. Diabetes
3. Asthma
4. Daily IBD

## Independent variables:

1. GNI per capita (constant 2010 US$)"
2. CHE / GDP
3. Any BF age 12m
